kedro-umbrella documentation
============================
This package implements the Function+Data Flow (FDF) boxes and a library of
commonly used functions for each box. We currently provide three nodes:

- **Code**: given the original (full-dimension) data, generate functions for
  encoding/decoding of data as in dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA,
  POD, etc.).
- **Train**: given two Data streams (input $I$ and output O), produce one
  Function $f$. This operator represents the supervised learning process. We
  expect that f such that $O \approx f(I)$.
- **Process**: given some original data, produce a transformed data by
  applying a Function with some Parameters. The Function is generated by the
  Code and Train nodes above and, hence, doesn't need to be explicitly
  written.
